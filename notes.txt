servers communicate with the internet through sockets in a host machine
its an abstraction provided by the operating system that acts as an
endpoint for comms bw the process/program and the network, it allows
data to be sent and received using a combination of IP address which gives
the machine info in the network, and the port number which tells about
the specific process on the machine that is sending or receiving the data

a process opens up a socket using system calls, and then that socket
is bound to the local IP address and port number hence allowing the OS
to associate the socket with a that specific process and network interface

in case of clients, its socket(since a client is also a process) is bound
to a remote server's IP address and port number, and in case of servers
they listen to incoming connections on a specific port number and IP address
(basically the clients), and once the connection is established the socket
provides a bidirectional comms channel for sending and recieving data

also when a webpage is loaded, the browser which is also a client creates
a socket to connect to the servers socket and then the comms involves
resolving the servers domain name to an IP address, opening a socket on 
local port, establishing a TCP connection to servers IP address and port
443(for https) and then exchanging http reqs and resps


the port number specifies the specific process or service running on the server
machine, and what the number does is help the OS of the server machine to route
the incoming network traffic to the correct process, for egs, port 80
is used by http servers, 443 for https, 8080 often used for web applications
